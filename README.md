## 🎯 How It Works

- Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore will be used to store user-submitted product reviews. These reviews could include textual data and ratings to the product (Reviews are stored in a structured format)

- Multimodal Analysis with Gemini API(Firebase Extension)  
   Text Analysis: Process reviews from Firestore to extract key themes, sentiments, and specific mentions of product features or issues.
- Steps for Analysis:
  1.  Extract raw review data from Firestore.
  2.  Send textual to the Gemini API for processing.
